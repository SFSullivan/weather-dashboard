# weather-dashboard

## The Task

To create a functioning weather dashboard that enables the user to search for a city and see it's weather as well as a 5 day forecast including variables such as temperature, humidity, etc. After a city is searched, it should save and allow the user to rapidly click a button and bring the information back to the screen. (It is still a work in progress)
